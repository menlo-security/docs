# About this repository
This repository is a prototype of what Menlo Security's documentation might look like with a completely different toolstack. 

# What's in this repository
There are a few things in this repository that are important to understand:

1. .github/workflows/*unzip-util.yml* - The GitHub actions script needed to take the .zip file that Paligo produces.
2. */scripts/* - Python scripts for carrying out essential tasks to unpack the .zip file, move files, and clean up. (More about these [here](https://github.com/johnapaz/unzip-util)).
3. *Everything else* - These files are managed in Paligo and should not be modified.
